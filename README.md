```
Introducing floating tubes- In the new game, tubes are never attached to a surface but rather float in air. 

We wanted users to score through the game, so we have introduced a new feature. 

In certain pipe configuration, you will be able to move below or above the tube,
unlike conventional game setting where tubes are quite often attached to the surface.
